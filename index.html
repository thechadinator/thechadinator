   <p id="life">
       I was born in St. Joseph, Michigan on January 23, 2000. I was born three years prior to my brother, and in 2003 my family moved out of Michigan and into the sunny state of Florida. I am currently majoring in Computer Information Systems, with a focus in programming, at <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/" target="_blank">Florida Gulf Coast University</a>. I've also held a job at <a href="https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/estero-fl" target="_blank">Culver's Of Estero</a> for almost two years now. Current interests include:
