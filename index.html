  <h2 class="me">About Me</h2>

   <p id="life">
       I was born in St. Joseph, Michigan on January 23, 2000. I was born three years prior to my brother, and in 2003 my family moved out of Michigan and into the sunny state of Florida. I am currently majoring in Computer Information Systems, with a focus in programming, at <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/" target="_blank">Florida Gulf Coast University</a>. I've also held a job at <a href="https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/estero-fl" target="_blank">Culver's Of Estero</a> for almost two years now. Current interests include:

       Over time, I have also gradually increased my coding skils. I have started to code both websites, such as this website, and have created small projects on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/thechadinator/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> and I am currently starting my education at FGCU as a Computer Information Systems major. I am currently taking <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/prof-v/lms/cop-1500" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Science</a> and rapidly learning how to code with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/thechadinator" target="_blank"> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a> Another huge hobby of mine is making music, so be sure to check me out on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/brigade-410042586" target="_blank">Soundcloud!</a>

  <h3 class="me">Achievements and Goals</h3>
      
    <p id="life">
      When I was in High School, I was in the Cambridge program and in the Advanced Placement program. I came into college with over 30 college credits, and high SAT and ACT scores. These high scores enabled me to get scholarships from FGCU, such as the <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/admissionsandaid/undergraduateadmissions/scholarshipsandwaivers.aspx" target="_blank">FGCU President's Gold Scholarship</a> and Bright Futures from the state. Some of my goals for the future include becoming an RA for South Village, becoming a teaching assistant for a computer science class, completing my 80 required service hours early, and staying on top of my homework.
